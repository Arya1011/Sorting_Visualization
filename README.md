# Sorting Visualization #
Sorting algorithms visualizer built using Javascript, HTML and CSS. Provides an option to change animation timeouts and also size of the array of bars to be sorted

**Sorting Visualizer is a web app for visualizing a bunch of different sorting algorithms like**
1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort

_Availablew with the functionality of_ ‚è≥(**_Processing Speed Control_**)  _and_   üìè(**_Array Size Control_**)

## ‚öô How it works ?!
-------------------
**Here in our model, each element value is represented by ```THE SIZE OF THE BAR``` and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right**

**The algorithms moves the items around by swapping elements, Without using any additional memory with creating another array**
